## About

waundle has been made for you to track the hills/mountains you've walked in the UK and Ireland. It
uses the [database of British and Irish Hills](https://www.hills-database.co.uk/) for this.

If you like the app and wish to drop me a coffee or beer, you can do so
through [Tipeee](https://en.tipeee.com/adam-j)
